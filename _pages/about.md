Hello, I'm an undergraduate student from Michigan State University studying Computational Neuroscience and Psychology. My research interests are in the application of information-theoretic principles to the study of the brain and behaviors and the computational modelling of neurological diseases. Currently, I'm part of an Electrical and Computer Engineering Research Lab, advised by professors from MSU, the University of Michigan, and Wayne State University who are all affiliated with the Michigan Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. I'm working on the modeling and evaluation of dynamic brain activity, functional connectivity & causality, biomarker development for the early detection of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimerâ€™s disease based on experimental EEG and fMRI data, and machine learning-based brain state space reconstruction.
